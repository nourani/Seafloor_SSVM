# Seafloor_SSVM - **Structural SVM for Hierarchical Classification**

##Introduction
Seafloor_SSVM is a repository with an implementation of a Structural SVM for hierarchical classification. The source code provided contains the implementation described in our IbPRIA 2015 paper for the particular problem of seafloor imagery taxonomic categorization. If you find this code useful in your research, please consider citing:

## How to compile the code?
We provide the script compile.sh to compile the project.
The code is developed and tested under Ubuntu 14.04 and the following libraries are 
required to build the code: gcc, cmake.

## How to reproduce the experiments in the paper with the TASIE dataset?

Explain how to run the software.

We provide the script xxx.sh to reproduce ALL the experiments of our IbPRIA publication.

## How to run my own experiments?
TODO: explain how to define your own hierarchy and the data in the code provided.
